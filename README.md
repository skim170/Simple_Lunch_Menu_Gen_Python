## Simple_Lunch_Menu_Gen_Python

This Python code creates a user-friendly lunch menu recommendation application using the Tkinter library for building the graphical user interface (GUI) and the random library for generating random menu suggestions. 
  
The application starts by importing the necessary libraries and defining a list of various lunch menu items. Users can input the number of menu recommendations they desire in an Entry widget, and upon clicking the "Recommend" button, the program utilizes random sampling to select the specified number of menu items from the list. These recommendations are then displayed in a Label widget. The main GUI window is titled "Lunch Menu Recommender," and the interface guides users through the process of receiving personalized lunch suggestions.  
The program continuously runs and remains responsive to user interactions due to the event loop established with `window.mainloop()`. This straightforward application provides an easy way to decide what to have for lunch by suggesting random menu items based on the user's preference for variety.
